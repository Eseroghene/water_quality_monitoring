# ðŸ’§ Water Quality Monitoring Project

This is a beginner-level Data Engineering project where you will build a simple pipeline using Python to process water sensor data and determine the safety of the water quality based on predefined thresholds.

---

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Learn to structure a Python project.
- Use Git for version control and push to GitHub.
- Work with CSV files using `pandas`.
- Practice data cleaning and transformation.
- Implement logic using functions and classes.
- Understand how code modularity works.
- Collaborate via branches using Git.
